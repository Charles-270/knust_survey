- ✅ **Works on all hosting platforms** (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)
- ✅ **No more blank pages** or missing assets

## Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Delete Old Deployment
If you deployed before and saw nothing, delete/remove the old deployment first.

### 2. Use This Fixed Package
- Upload ALL files from this `deployment-package` folder
- Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory
- Include the `assets/` folder with all its contents

### 3. Platform-Specific Instructions

#### Netlify (Drag & Drop)
- Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
- Delete previous deployment if any
- Drag this entire `deployment-package` folder
- Should work immediately!

#### GitHub Pages
- Upload all these files to your repository root
- Make sure `index.html` is in the root, not in a subfolder
- Enable Pages in Settings

#### Vercel
- Delete previous deployment
- Upload these files or run `vercel --prod` in this folder

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ❌ **Blank Page / Nothing Shows**
**Cause**: Wrong file structure or absolute paths
**Fix**: Use this updated package with relative paths

### ❌ **Files Not Loading**
**Check**: 
1. All files uploaded including `assets/` folder?
2. `index.html` in the root directory?
3. File names match exactly (case-sensitive)?

### ❌ **Console Errors**
**Open browser developer tools (F12) and check for:**
- 404 errors (missing files)
- Path errors (wrong file locations)
- JavaScript errors

### ❌ **Survey Loads But Looks Broken**
**Cause**: CSS file not loading
**Check**: `assets/index-3GE-Q7hA.css` file exists and is accessible

## File Structure (Must Match)
```
your-website-root/
├── index.html                 # Main file
├── assets/
│   ├── index-3GE-Q7hA.css    # Styles
│   └── index-Xi-vK43A.js     # App code
├── scout-tag.js              # Scout branding
└── vite.svg                  # Icon
```

## Test Your Deployment
1. **Main Survey**: `https://your-domain.com`

## Still Having Issues?

### Quick Fixes:
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

4. **Verify all files uploaded correctly**
